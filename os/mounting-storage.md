# Mounting Storage

The [cloud-config]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/cluster-management/setup/cloudinit-cloud-config) *mount unit* mechanism is used to attach additional filesystems to CoreOS nodes, whether such storage is provided by an underlying cloud platform, physical disk, SAN, or NAS system. By [systemd convention](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.mount.html), mount unit names derive from the target mount point, with interior slashes replaced by dashes, and the `.mount` extension appended. A unit mounting onto `/var/www` is thus named `var-www.mount`.

Mount units name the source filesystem and target mount point, and optionally the filesystem type. Cloud-config writes mount unit files beneath `/etc/systemd/system`. *Systemd* mounts filesystems defined in such units at boot time. The following example mounts an [EC2 ephemeral disk]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/running-coreos/cloud-providers/ec2/#instance-storage) at the node's `/media/ephemeral` directory, and is therefore named `media-ephemeral.mount`:

```yaml
#cloud-config

coreos:
  units:
    - name: media-ephemeral.mount
      command: start
      content: |
        [Mount]
        What=/dev/xvdb
        Where=/media/ephemeral
        Type=ext3
```

## Use Attached Storage for Docker

Docker containers can be very large and debugging a build process makes it easy to accumulate hundreds of containers. It's advantageous to use attached storage to expand your capacity for container images. Be aware that some cloud providers treat certain disks as ephemeral and you will lose all Docker images contained on that disk.

We're going to mount a btrfs device to `/var/lib/docker`, where Docker stores images. We can do this on the fly when the machines starts up with a oneshot unit that formats the drive and another one that runs afterwards to mount it. Be sure to hardcode the correct device or look for a device by label:

```yaml
#cloud-config
coreos:
  units:
    - name: format-ephemeral.service
      command: start
      content: |
        [Unit]
        Description=Formats the ephemeral drive
        After=dev-xvdb.device
        Requires=dev-xvdb.device
        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        RemainAfterExit=yes
        ExecStart=/usr/sbin/wipefs -f /dev/xvdb
        ExecStart=/usr/sbin/mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/xvdb
    - name: var-lib-docker.mount
      command: start
      content: |
        [Unit]
        Description=Mount ephemeral to /var/lib/docker
        Requires=format-ephemeral.service
        After=format-ephemeral.service
        Before=docker.service
        [Mount]
        What=/dev/xvdb
        Where=/var/lib/docker
        Type=btrfs
```

Notice that we're starting both units at the same time and using the power of systemd to work out the dependencies for us. In this case, `var-lib-docker.mount` requires `format-ephemeral.service`, ensuring that our storage will always be formatted before it is mounted. Docker will refuse to start otherwise.

## Creating and Mounting a btrfs Volume File

CoreOS [561.0.0](https://coreos.com/releases/#561.0.0) and later are installed with ext4 + overlayfs to provide a layered filesystem for the root partition.
Installations from prior to this, are using btrfs for this functionality.
If you'd like to continue using btrfs on newer CoreOS machines, you can do so with two systemd units: one that creates and formats a btrfs volume file and another that mounts it.

In this example, we are going to mount a new 25GB btrfs volume file to `/var/lib/docker`, and one can verify that Docker is using the btrfs storage driver once the Docker service has started by executing `sudo docker info`.
We recommend allocating **no more than 85%** of the available disk space for a btrfs filesystem as journald will also require space on the host filesystem.

```yaml
#cloud-config
coreos:
  units:
    - name: format-var-lib-docker.service
      command: start
      content: |
        [Unit]
        Before=docker.service var-lib-docker.mount
        ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/docker.btrfs
        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=/usr/bin/truncate --size=25G /var/lib/docker.btrfs
        ExecStart=/usr/sbin/mkfs.btrfs /var/lib/docker.btrfs
    - name: var-lib-docker.mount
      enable: true
      content: |
        [Unit]
        Before=docker.service
        After=format-var-lib-docker.service
        Requires=format-var-lib-docker.service
        [Install]
        RequiredBy=docker.service
        [Mount]
        What=/var/lib/docker.btrfs
        Where=/var/lib/docker
        Type=btrfs
        Options=loop,discard
```

Note the declaration of `ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/docker.btrfs`. Without this line, systemd would reformat the btrfs filesystem every time the machine starts.

## Mounting NFS Exports

This cloud-config excerpt enables the NFS host monitor [`rpc.statd(8)`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/rpc.statd), then mounts an NFS export onto the CoreOS node's `/var/www`.

```yaml
#cloud-config
coreos:
  units:
    - name: rpc-statd.service
      command: start
      enable: true
    - name: var-www.mount
      command: start
      content: |
        [Mount]
        What=nfs.example.com:/var/www
        Where=/var/www
        Type=nfs
```

To declare that another service depends on this mount, name the mount unit in the dependent unit's `After` and `Requires` properties:

```yaml
[Unit]
After=var-www.mount
Requires=var-www.mount
```

If the mount fails, dependent units will not start.
