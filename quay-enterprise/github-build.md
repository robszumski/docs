# Setup GitHub Build Triggers

CoreOS Enterprise Registry supports using GitHub or GitHub Enterprise as a trigger to building
images.

## Initial Setup

If you have not yet done so, please <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/enterprise-registry/build-support/">enable build support</a> in the Enterprise Registry.

## Create an OAuth Application in GitHub

Following the instructions at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/enterprise-registry/github-app/">Create a GitHub Application</a>.

**NOTE:** This application must be **different** from that used for GitHub Authentication.

## Visit the Management Panel

Sign in to a super user account and visit `http://yourregister/superuser` to view the management panel:

## Tag an Automated Build

After getting automated builds working, it may be desired to tag a specific build with a name. By default, the last image pushed to a repository will be tagged as `latest`.
Because tagging is [usually done client side](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/#setting-tags-on-an-image) before an image is pushed, it may not be clear how to tag an image that was built and pushed by GitHub. Luckily, there is a interface for doing so on the repository page. After clicking to select a given build on the build graph, the right side of the page displays tag information which when clicked provides a drop-down menu with the option of creating a new tag.

There is currently no ability to automatically tag GitHub triggered builds.
