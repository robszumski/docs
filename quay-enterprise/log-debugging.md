- To view logs for each service, click the service name at the top. The logs will update automatically.

## Contacting support

When contacting support, one should always include a copy of the Enterprise Registry's log directory.

To download logs, click the "<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download All Local Logs (.tar.gz)" link
